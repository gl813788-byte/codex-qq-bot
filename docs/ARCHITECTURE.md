# Architecture

[简体中文](ARCHITECTURE_CN.md) | English

This document is the map for changing the project without having to rediscover its boundaries from `src/server.js`.

## Runtime flow

```text
environment + runtime paths
          |
          v
    initial app state
          |
          v
 HTTP hub / channel adapter ------> QQ / OneBot
          v
 domain services -------------> memory, persona, stickers, web search

          v
 infrastructure -------------> Codex CLI, files, processes, logs
```

`src/server.js` is the composition root. It wires dependencies, starts the HTTP listener and owns process shutdown. It is still a transitional monolith, not the intended home for new subsystems. New parsing, policy and persistence logic belongs in a focused module and is only wired from the composition root.

## Source layout

| Path | Responsibility | Change here when... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/app/` | Application state and startup composition | changing global state shape or startup lifecycle |
| `src/channels/qq/` | Single QQ and OneBot message transport boundary | parsing or validating incoming QQ events |
| `src/config/` | Environment normalization and runtime defaults | adding an environment variable or changing a deployment default |
| `src/qq-enhancer/` | Optional QQ reply behavior | changing context images, proactive interest or reply style |
| `src/qq-main-prompt.js` | Main-model prompt boundary | changing role, execution order, approved proactive tasks or the need-based tool directory |
| `src/qq-proactive-pipeline.js` | Two-model proactive-chat contract | interest approvals and mandatory main-model validation for ordinary interjections, cold topic/chatter, and private outreach |
| `src/qq-message-run-compaction.js` | Model-context repeat-run compaction | semantic identity, count merging, and Chinese count annotations for adjacent duplicate messages |
| `src/codex-app-server-turn.js` | One-turn Codex app-server client | `thread/start`/`thread/resume`, `turn/start`, in-flight `turn/steer`, timeout, and interruption |
| `src/qq-reply-steering.js` | QQ follow-up fusion scheduler | quiet-window debounce, snapshot consumption, failure retention, and active-turn identity checks |
| `src/qq-codex-session.js` | QQ Codex session policy | temporary/persistent/auto selection, frequency thresholds, and normalized thread-map retention |
| `src/qq-outgoing-mentions.js` | Outgoing QQ mention resolver | exact name/QQ-number parsing, ambiguity rejection, group-member caching, and real `at` segment construction |
| `src/qq-knowledge-base.js` | QQ long-term knowledge domain | changing title/scope policy, slang matching, frequency evidence, deletion review state or its repository |
| `src/dashboard-knowledge-base.js` | Dashboard knowledge-management boundary | validating exact scoped upserts/deletes, stale conflicts, and frequency-evidence preservation |
| `src/qq-knowledge-review.js` | Complex knowledge-review prompt boundary | bounded interest triage, full-evidence main review, and strict result parsing |
| `src/unified-memory/` | Cross-channel memory | changing recall, storage or prompt formatting |
| `src/*.js` | Existing domain and infrastructure modules | changing the named capability while it is migrated incrementally |
| `modules/` | Platform clients and optional integrations | changing shared UI, launchers or the QQ social bridge |
| `scripts/` | Operator and deployment commands | changing checks, deployment or the `ncc` CLI |
| `test/` | Node test suite | every behavior change or extracted boundary |
| `data/` | Local persistent state | never source code; preserve across updates |
| `runtime/` | Logs, generated replies and temporary output | never source code; preserve while diagnosing |

## Dependency rules

1. Channel adapters normalize untrusted payloads before application logic sees them.
2. New environment settings go through `createEnvironmentConfig`; feature modules receive normalized values instead of reading `process.env` directly. Remaining direct reads in `server.js` are migration debt, not a pattern to copy.
3. Initial mutable state is created through `createInitialState`; tests and future embedded runtimes can obtain isolated state instances.
4. Domain modules must not start listeners, install signal handlers or terminate the process.
5. Filesystem, child-process and network side effects should sit behind a small exported function or factory so callers can test policy without performing the side effect.
6. Keep local data in `data/` and generated output in `runtime/`; do not import runtime files as source code.

## Configuration lifecycle

```text
process environment / config/local.env
                 |
                 v
       createEnvironmentConfig
                 |
                 v
          startup defaults
                 |
                 +---- data/settings.json overrides persisted settings
                 v
              app state
```

`config/local.env` is sourced by the repository `ncc start` command. A direct `npm start` only receives the caller's existing process environment. `data/settings.json` stores user-facing settings and overrides the corresponding startup defaults after it is loaded. Secrets should remain in the environment; see [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md).

## Runtime boundaries

- **HTTP:** the dashboard and management API expose public state, maintenance status and logs. Non-loopback access is rejected unless remote binding and authentication are explicitly configured.
- **OneBot:** webhook payloads are authenticated or restricted to loopback, size-limited, normalized and deduplicated before QQ policy runs.
- **Codex:** ordinary QQ replies run through steerable app-server turns. The fusion buffer submits one selected follow-up batch with `turn/steer`; persistent scopes resume the same local thread from a fresh controlled app-server process. Every child still receives the controlled environment, concurrency limits, and current QQ model settings.
- **Model responsibilities:** the configured OpenRouter, DeepSeek, or custom OpenAI-compatible interest model is the lightweight background-decision and miscellaneous-triage plane. Provider adaptation is isolated in `src/interest-model-provider.js`; secrets stay in environment configuration while provider/model selection is persisted. It handles only bounded triggers, classification, risk labels, and simple review. The main Codex model owns conversation, summaries, tool research, topic selection, knowledge extraction, complex reasoning, and final replies.
- **Storage:** settings, memory and social state are local files. The QQ-scope-to-Codex-thread map is atomically stored in `data/qq-codex-sessions.json` without duplicating thread content. `qq-knowledge-base` already uses a repository for safe loading and atomic writes; malformed input preserves the original file and enables read-only protection. Other load/save paths should move behind repositories incrementally.
- **Recurring work:** `src/wall-clock-scheduler.js` only wakes domain checks. Due times stay in domain stores: ordinary-interest cycles and short-term memory use `data/qq-memory.json`, knowledge-frequency review uses `data/qq-knowledge-base.json`, and adaptive/persona clocks remain in their persona files. Startup and channel restoration run one immediate catch-up pass, and completed work establishes the next clock anchor. Low-frequency knowledge review first uses the `qq-enhancer` structured channel for bounded interest triage, then starts the main Codex model for full-evidence final review.

## Adding a feature

1. Pick the narrowest domain module. Create a directory under `src/channels/`, `src/app/` or an existing domain when the boundary is clear.
2. Add configuration in `src/config/environment.js`, including defaulting and bounds, instead of adding another direct `process.env` read to `src/server.js`.
3. Export pure parsing and policy functions separately from side-effecting functions.
4. Wire the module in `src/server.js`; keep the wiring small.
5. Add a focused `test/<capability>.test.js` file and run `npm run verify`.

## Incremental extraction roadmap

The remaining `src/server.js` code should be reduced in behavior-preserving slices:

1. Move dashboard/API route handlers into `src/channels/http/` with explicit service dependencies.
2. Move OneBot API calls and QQ reply delivery into `src/channels/qq/`.
3. Move Codex CLI execution and quota discovery into `src/infrastructure/codex/`.
4. Move settings and memory persistence into repositories under `src/infrastructure/storage/`.

Each slice should keep the public API stable and land with its own regression tests. Avoid a single large file-move commit: it makes behavioral review and rollback harder.

## Change checklist

1. Identify the boundary and its untrusted inputs.
2. Preserve persisted schemas or add a compatible migration.
3. Add focused unit tests and integration coverage where side effects meet policy.
4. Run `npm run verify`.
5. Update both language versions of affected documentation and the packaged skill when operator behavior changes.
